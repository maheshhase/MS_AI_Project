# MSA AI â€“ Chatbot Project

## Problem Identification

In recent years, most of the developed economies need economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Developed countries have been forced to rethink their development pathways in accordance with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies.

Renewable energy investment has increased significantly in Australia over recent years, contributing to a continuing shift in the energy generation mix away from traditional fossil fuel sources.

It is evident that people will be curious and need ready resource which can answer their queries related to renewable energy investment. This project tries to resolve this issue by building a ChatBot service using Microsoft Azure Portal for AI services.
