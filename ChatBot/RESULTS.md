# Results and Findings

## Findings from the research
From Energy analysis, I found that
-  Average Energy Productivity of all Australian States lies between approximately 210 and 324 AUD million/petajoules. The energy consumption of Australia grew steadily from 5,000 petajoules in 2001 to 6,200 petajoules in 2019.
-  NSW is the leader in terms of Energy Productivity with a ratio of ~ 324 AUD million/petajoules, whereas WA is laggard in terms of Energy Productivity with ratio of ~ 210 AUD million/petajoules. 
-  QLD, WA, and NT have shown a steady increase in energy consumption from 2001 to 2019. NT's energy consumption almost doubled from 2001 figures to 2019 figures.
-  However, energy consumption of NSW, VIC, SA and TAS remained almost constant throughout past decade.
-  In Australia, on average, Transport & Utilities sector are leading in terms of Energy Consumption as these sectors form the foundation of the growth of all other industries. This is followed by Manufacturing & Mining sector which leads the economic growth in Australia.

## Results
When I combined energy analysis with economy & emissions analysis, I found that,
- Australia’s path towards sustainable economic development has started after signing the Paris climate agreement, also known as the Paris accord (replacement of Kyoto Protocol) in 2005.
- Before 2005, Renewable Energy generation was muted, and emissions were increasing. 
- But, after taking the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the global temperature increase, we see growth in both Economy (GDP) & Renewable Energy generation, resulting in lower CO2 emissions.
- This confirms Australia’s path towards sustainable economic development. However, within Australia, we see that renewable energy generation is not proportional to the economy (i.e., GDP). 
- For the last entire decade, Tasmania (TAS) always has a majority share in renewable energy generation. TAS is famous for renewable energy generation mainly from Hydro. The state produces more energy than it consumes. But, surprisingly, this state is laggard when comes to the Economy with the lowest per capita GDP.
- Similarly, it is surprising to find that Northern Territory (NT) is the leader in per capita GDP throughout the last decade (maybe because of less population), but always has a negligible share of renewable energy generation.

## Reflection
- For the first time, I tried **cloud services** in a low-code mode and learn new things about Azure Portal
- I understood details about QnA maker, Text Analytics, Resource group and Knowledge Base which helped me a lot to develop a ChatBot for investment in Renewable Energy

## Hindsight Bias
- Project would be much effective if I could include more resources about 1MB limit for free tier account
- Also, manual efforts to design QnA would be reduced if I could use preview feature using text analytics to design custom question and answers.
- Finally, I could not deploy final stage of production which is Web chat project due to limitations of free tier account.
