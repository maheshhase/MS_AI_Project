Summary of my learnings from this project are captured below :

1. I started my learning journey by reading material on fundamental of AI i.e. `AI-900 on microsoft certification` website followed by couple of resources mentioned by the MSA program team. I learned that AI systems can exhibit human characteristics to analyze the world around them, make predictions or inferences, and act on them in ways that we could only imagine a short time ago.

2. I explored **machine learning** and learned how to use the automated machine learning capability of Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy a predictive model. learned how to use Azure Machine Learning designer to train and publish a **regression, classification and clustering model**.

3. I learned how to apply best practices for fueling innovation at my workplace and prioritize **AI investments**. I also learned how **MLOps** practices facilitate better business results, enable faster time to market, and how MLOps practices increase collaboration and alignment across teams to accelerate the ML lifecycle.

4. I further learned about increasing productivity and tech intensity across business units with **fusion development teams**.I also understood what **Power Fx** is and how to use it and how tocreate a custom **Power Apps component**.

5. Finally, I further explored how Power Apps can make your business more efficient. I learned Learn about the different ways to build an app in **Power Apps**. I also learned how to customize an app by adding controls, images, and logic and how to view and restore **app versions**, their environments and security.

I am very much satisfied with this achievement as I have absoultely Zero knowledge about cloud services before starting my MSA journey. Very excited for the next project - `Internet of Things with Azure`
