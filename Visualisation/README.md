### I. Introduction

In recent years, most of the developed economies need economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Developed countries have been forced to rethink their development pathways following the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies.

For sustainable growth, emissions must reduce as a country make economic growth. Such growth can be termed sustainable as it does not use fossil fuels for growth. To explore this further, I decided to focus on the Energy, Economy and Emissions parameters of Australia, one of the developed countries, and analyse its path towards sustainable development over the past decades.
