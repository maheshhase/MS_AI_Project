Renewable energy investment has increased significantly in Australia over recent years, contributing to a continuing shift in the energy generation mix away from traditional fossil fuel sources. It is evident that people will be curious and need ready resource which can answer their queries related to renewable energy investment. This project tries to resolve this issue by building a ChatBot service using Microsoft Azure Portal for AI services.

In recent years, most of the developed economies need economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Developed countries have been forced to rethink their development pathways in accordance with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies.
To explore this further, I decided to focus on the Energy, Economy and Emission parameters of Australia, one of the developed countries, and analyse its path towards sustainable development over the past decades. For this data exploration project, I have selected four data sets containing information about the Australian population, GDP, Energy Consumption, Electricity Generation and CO2 Emissions.
